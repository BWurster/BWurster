# Hi there, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

## I am currently a student at University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my coursework
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about tools to facilitate software development and data processing
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any tips and tricks that are helpful to someone with little to no experience.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects, family and friends, or my ambitions for the future.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Soccer is one of my passions I love to play to destress.
